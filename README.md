Start the Server: After installing the packages, you can start your server. Make sure you have a server file (e.g., server.js or app.js) in your project directory. You can start the server by running:

Copy code
node server.js
(Replace server.js with the name of your main server file if it's different.)

Access the Application: Once the server is running, you can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000 (or the port you have configured).

Make sure to let users know they need to have Node.js and npm installed on their machine before running these commands. This guide should help them set up the environment and start the server successfully.
